##Tasks: 

###Mandatory Objectives:

+ Create a Windows application
+ Choose Programming Style Guidelines that you'll follow
+ Add 2 buttons to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)
+ Add 2 text inputs to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)
+ Add 2 text elements to window: one with default styles, one with custom styles (size, background, text color, font family, font size)

### Objectives With Points:
+ Make elements to fit window on resize (1 pt) (hint: you can limit minimal window width and height)
+ Make elements to interact or change other elements (1 pt for 2 different interactions) (0-2 pt) (ex. on button click, change text element color or position)
+ Change behavior of different window actions (at least 3). For ex.: on clicking close button, move window to a random location on display working space (1 pt)
+ Write your own PSG (you can take existent one and modify it) and argue why it is better (for you) (1 pt)
